Objective Bayesian Variable Selection for Occupancy Models

This code in R enables users to perform the Bayesian variable selection algorithm introduced in:

Taylor-Rodríguez, Daniel; Womack, Andrew J.; Fuentes, Claudio; Bliznyuk, Nikolay Intrinsic Bayesian analysis for 
occupancy models. Bayesian Anal. 12 (2017), no. 3, 855–877.

The methodology uses objective Bayesian priors on the model parameters (explicitly, Intrinsic Priors), and enables Bayesian
testing through a stochastic search algorithm for higher order interactions and polynomial terms under strong heredity 
constraints.  The priors considered for the model space correspond to the ones proposed in:


Daniel Taylor-Rodriguez, Andrew Womack & Nikolay Bliznyuk (2016) Bayesian Variable Selection on Model Spaces Constrained by 
Heredity Conditions, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 25:2, 515-535, DOI: 10.1080/10618600.2015.1056793.
